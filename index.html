     <h2> Dorothy Vaughan</h2>

     <p>In 1943, Dorothy Vaughan, a 32-year-old high school mathematics teacher, started a new job.
        She became a Grade P1 mathematician, helping with the wartime effort at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory.
        As the prime aircraft test facility of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), Langley was racing to make combat planes fly further, faster, on less fuel. </p>
      <br>
     <p>To process the deluge of data from wind tunnels and other experiments, Langley needed number crunchers. It found them in “human computers”.
        These mathematicians were all women and, thanks to a recent executive order banning racial discrimination in defence hiring, many – like Vaughan – were black. </p>

    <h2>Miriam Mann</h2>

    <p>Miriam Mann started work as a Langley computer in 1943, thinking she would stay only as long as the war effort required her.
       But the war came and went, and Mann stayed – unlike the sign in  the cafeteria. </p>
    <p> It read “Colored Computers” and relegated the black women of West Computing to a lone rear table. For Mann, this was too much.
       She took the sign away. Although a replacement materialised before long, the little rebellion shook up the department.</p>

  <p class="grey"> Identifying The Black females impact in Comper science.
      In 2002, 1.3% of the computer science doctorate degrees earned were awarded to Black women. 
      In 2017, two female computer scientists Timnit Gebru and Rediet Abebe founded the workshop Black in AI, in order to help increases the presence and inclusion of Black people in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
